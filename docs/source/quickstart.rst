Quickstart

Get information about a file
--------------------------------

Start by importing the `vt` module:

>>> import vt

Create a client, replace `<apikey>` with your actual VirusTotal API key:

>>> client = vt.Client("<apikey>")

Ask for the file you are interested in, you can replace the hash in the example
with some other SHA-256, SHA-1 or MD5:

>>> file = client.get_object("/files/44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f")

Now `file` is an instance of :class:`vt.Object` that contains information
about the requested file. This object have the attributes returned in the
API response which are listed in the `VirusTotal API v3 documentation
<https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#files>`_. Some examples:

>>> file.size
68

>>> file.sha256
'275a021bbfb6489e54d471899f7db9d1663fc695ec2fe2a2c4538aabf651fd0f'

>>> file.type_tag
'text'

>>> file.last_analysis_stats
{'failure': 0, 'harmless': 0, 'malicious': 62, 'suspicious': 0, 'timeout': 0, 'type-unsupported': 9, 'undetected': 2}

Alternatively, you can use the :meth:`vt.Object.get` method for retrieving
object's attributes:

>>> file.get("size")
68

>>> file.get("type_tag")
'text'

This method is useful for those attributes that are optional and do not appear
in all files. For example, a Portable Executable (PE) file won't have the `pdf_info`
attribute, and PDF document won't have the `pe_info` attribute. This means that
`file.pe_info` will fail for PDF files but with `file.get("pe_info")` you are
on the safe side, as it will return `None` if the `pe_info` attribute is not
present.

Get information about an URL
----------------------------

Create a client as explained in the previous section and ask for the desired
URL as follows:

>>> url_id = vt.url_id("http://www.virustotal.com")
>>> url = client.get_object("/urls/{}", url_id)

In this case the code is not as straightforward as it was for getting a file.
While retrieving a file any of its hashes can be used as the file identifier,
but with URLs is a bit more complicated. You must use :func:`vt.url_id` for
generating the appropriate identifier. You can find more information about why
this is necessary in:
`<https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#url>`_.

Also notice how we are using a placeholder `{}` in the path. The placeholder
will be replaced with the value of `url_id`. This works exactly like Python's
`new-style string formatting <https://pyformat.info/>`_ using the `.format()`
function. This other code is equivalent:

>>> url = client.get_object("/urls/{}".format(url_id))

The returned object contains the URL attributes. Some examples:

>>> url.times_submitted
213730

>>> url.last_analysis_stats
{'harmless': 61, 'malicious': 0, 'suspicious': 1, 'timeout': 0, 'undetected': 8}


Scan a file
-----------

Before scanning a file is highly recommended that you look up for it as
described in `Get information about a file <#get-information-about-a-file>`_.
If the file already exists and the lastest analysis is fresh enough, you can
use that instead of scanning the file again. If not, you can scan it with:

>>> with open("/path/to/file", "rb") as f:
>>>   analysis = client.scan_file(f)

When :meth:`vt.Client.scan_file` returns the analysis is not completed yet,
the object returned only has the analysis ID but not attributes. In order to
track the status of the analysis you must ask for the analysis object until
it's status is `completed`:

>>> while True:
>>>   analysis = client.get_object("/analyses/{}", analysis.id)
>>>   print(analysis.status)
>>>   if analysis.status == "completed":
>>>      break
>>>   time.sleep(30)

Alternatively you can use the `wait_for_completion` argument:

>>> with open("/path/to/file", "rb") as f:
>>>   analysis = client.scan_file(f, wait_for_completion=True)

When `wait_for_completion` is True :meth:`vt.Client.scan_file` doesn't return
until the analysis has been completed.


Scan an URL
-----------

Scanning a URL is very similar to `scanning a file <#scan-a-file>`_, you just
need to use :meth:`vt.Client.scan_url` instead of :meth:`vt.Client.scan_file`:

>>> analysis = client.scan_url('https://somedomain.com/foo/bar')


Download a file
---------------

.. note::
    This feature is available only for premium users.

Downloading a file it's very simple, you only need to provide the hash and a
file-like object where the file's content will be written to. The target file
must be opened in `"wb"` mode:

>>> with open("/path/to/target_file", "wb") as f:
>>>   client.download_file("44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f", f)


Start and abort a Retrohunt job
-------------------------------

.. note::
    This feature is available only for premium users.

Create an empty object of type `retrohunt_job` and set its `rules` attribute:

>>> job = vt.Object("retrohunt_job")
>>> job.rules = "rule test { condition:false }"

Post the object to the `/intelligence/retrohunt_jobs` collection:

>>> job = client.post_object("/intelligence/retrohunt_jobs", obj=job)

Notice that `job` has been replaced with the value returned by
:func:`vt.Client.post_object`, so now `job` has an ID and additional
attributes.

>>> job.id
'username-123456789'

>>> job.status
'starting'

With the object identifier you can ask for the job again a see it making
progress. Wait for a few seconds and do:

>>> job = client.get_object("/intelligence/retrohunt_jobs/{}", job.id)

The job status should have changed to `running`:

>>> job.status
'running'

And the progress attribute should show the completion percentage:

>>> job.progress
1.4145595

Let's abort the job:

>>> response = client.post("/intelligence/retrohunt_jobs/{}/abort", job.id)
>>> response.status
200

Here we are using :meth:`vt.Client.post` instead of :meth:`vt.Client.post_object`,
this is because the `/intelligence/retrohunt_jobs/{id}/abort
<https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#abort-retrohunt-job>`_
endpoint doesn't expect an object, just a POST request with an empty body. The
result from :meth:`vt.Client.post` is a :class:`vt.ClientResponse` instance.


Create a LiveHunt ruleset
-------------------------

.. note::
    This feature is available only for premium users.

Create an empty object of type `hunting_ruleset` and set its `name` and
`rules` attributes:

>>> rs = vt.Object("hunting_ruleset")
>>> rs.name = "My test ruleset"
>>> rs.rules = "rule test { condition:false }"

Post the object to the `/intelligence/hunting_rulesets` collection:

>>> rs = client.post_object("/intelligence/hunting_rulesets", obj=rs)

Because we didn't set the `enabled` attribute while creating the ruleset, it
was created with `enabled=False` by default:

>>> rs.enabled
False

Let's enable the ruleset:

>>> rs.enabled = True
>>> rs = client.patch_object("/intelligence/hunting_rulesets/{}", rs.id, obj=rs)
>>> rs.enabled
True
