This example program shows how to use the vt-py synchronous API for getting
the VirusTotal file feed. For a more elaborate example that includes the use
of cursors and the asynchronous API see file_feed_async.py.

NOTICE: In order to use this program you will need an API key that has
privileges for using the VirusTotal Feed API.
