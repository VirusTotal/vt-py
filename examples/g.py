"""Console 1-click tool to download files from VT.

It could be extremely handy to malware analysts in their day-to-day job.

Setup:
1) Put script in your Path directory and set execution permission
   if needed (chmod 755).
2) Set VT_API_KEY environment variable, note that download file permission
   is needed.
3) You might want to rename it to single character for quick access
   ("g.py" -> "g").

Usage:
1) g 44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f - will download file with this hash to
   your current working directory (CWD).
MD5, SHA1, SHA256 - supported file checksums.

2) g 123.txt - will read list of hashes from 123.txt file, one per line and
   download them in CWD.
